floating 3d platforms
to kill players you must push them off the map
attacks can be combined with elementals to create new attacks
eg.
bomb attack with fire elemental becomes fire bomb
punch attack with ice elemental becomes ice punch

elements can also be combined

elements:
fire: applies dot damage, removes ice effect
ice: causes enemies to attack slower, removes fire effect
air: high knockback, low damage
earth: high damage, low knockback

team based fights
each player starts with a set amount of lives
each palyer starts with one element and one attack
everytime a player on your team dies, you get to choose a new element, or attack

combinations:
---fire---
ice: creates steam, which can be used on a teammate to remove ice and fire effects
air: low damage, medium knockback, causes dot damage
earth: low knockback, medium damage, causes dot damage

---ice---
air: low damage, medium knockback, causes attack slow
earth: low knockback, medium damage, causes attack slow

---air---
earth: results in medium knockback and damage
